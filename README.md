# Solar Radiation Measurement Analysis
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of solar radiation data collected from three regions. By exploring attributes such as air temperature 🌡️, relative humidity 💧, wind speed 🌬️, and solar radiation intensity ☀️, this analysis aims to uncover trends and patterns that could support renewable energy planning and meteorological research. Using Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib, this repository offers insights through statistical summaries, z-score analysis, correlation matrices, and time-series visualizations 📊. The project also includes data quality checks and preprocessing steps to ensure accurate and reliable outcomes.

A key feature of this project is the interactive Streamlit dashboard 💻, which allows users to explore data insights in real-time. The dashboard integrates multiple analysis scripts and visualizations, providing a user-friendly interface for observing solar radiation trends across various parameters. Additionally, the repository includes documentation on installation, data sources, and detailed instructions on using the dashboard. This analysis serves as a valuable resource for researchers, policymakers, and energy planners interested in optimizing solar energy usage and improving environmental data accessibility.
